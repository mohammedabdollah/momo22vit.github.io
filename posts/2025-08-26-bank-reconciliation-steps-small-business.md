# Bank Reconciliation Steps for Small Business (with Example)

Keeping cash accurate is non-negotiable for any small business. A **bank reconciliation** (Arabic: *تسوية*) compares your cash balance in the books to the bank statement, explains the differences, and updates your records.

## What is bank reconciliation?
It’s the process of matching the transactions in your **books** to the **bank statement**, identifying timing differences (e.g., *outstanding checks* and *deposits in transit*) and any errors. Accurate reconciliations help you catch fraud, fees, and posting mistakes quickly.

## The 4 core steps
1. **Gather documents**: latest bank statement, cash ledger/export from your accounting system, and prior month’s reconciliation.
2. **Match transactions**: tick off deposits and payments that appear on both sides.
3. **List timing differences**:
   - *Outstanding checks* (issued but not yet cleared)
   - *Deposits in transit* (recorded by you, not yet by the bank)
   - Bank items like **fees**, **interest**, or **NSF** that aren’t in your books yet
4. **Post adjusting entries** to books:
   - Record bank fees/interest
   - Fix duplicates or amounts entered incorrectly
   - Update your ending **book balance** to the **adjusted balance**

## Worked example (numbers you can follow)
- Bank ending balance on 31 Aug: **$5,240**
- Book ending balance on 31 Aug: **$5,100**

Timing differences:
- Outstanding check #1025: **$250**
- Deposit on Aug 31 posted Sep 1: **$500** (deposit in transit)
- Bank fee on Aug 30 not in books: **$10**

**Adjust books**:
- Record bank fee: `Dr Bank Fees 10  / Cr Cash 10`

**Reconciliation**  
Books $5,100 − $10 (fee) = **$5,090** (adjusted books)  
Bank $5,240 − $500 (DIT) − $0 + $250 (OC) = **$4,990**  
> If the two adjusted balances don’t match, look for unmatched/duplicate transactions and amounts.

## Tips to keep reconciliations fast
- Reconcile **weekly** if volume is high.
- Use **bank feeds** (Arabic: *مزامنة البنك*) to pull transactions daily and reduce manual entry.
- Keep a running list of recurring bank charges to post them quickly next month.

## FAQ (quick wins)
**Is reconciliation different from cashbook review?**  
Yes. Reconciliation proves your **book balance** equals the **bank’s** after timing differences and corrections.

**How often should a small business reconcile?**  
Monthly at a minimum; weekly if you process many payments.

**What if a check stays outstanding for months?**  
Investigate—void and reissue if necessary according to your policy.
